# Bamazon-Storefront

Modify the products table so that there's a product_sales column, and modify your bamazonCustomer.js app 
so that when a customer purchases anything from the store, 
the price of the product multiplied by the quantity purchased is added to the product's product_sales column.



Make sure your app still updates the inventory listed in the products column.
